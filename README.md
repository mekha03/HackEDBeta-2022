Project Description:
  --> This is a simple 'Runner'-style game. You use the spacebar to jump, 
      and you get points for each homework assignment that you avoid (ironic, isn't it?). 
      If you hit an assignment, the game ends and you are prompted to restart by hitting 
      the spacebar again. It is coded using the pygame module in Python.
      
Running Instructions:
  1. 
    i) In your Python Editior, do to project settings and add 'pygame' as an interpeter 
       since it doens't automatically come with Python
       - or -
    ii) Type 'pip install pygame' (no quotations) into your command line
    
  2. Open the files and run the game
    --> Ensure that all files are in the same location as main.py, 
        otherwise it will not work.
